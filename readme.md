## Configurations

The `configure.js` file holds examples of what your configuration will look like.
Configuration for *Lil'DressUp* is basically just passing all your data game into your main `DressUp` class object.

## Usage

*Lil'DressUp* comes with a premade screen system for switching between the menu, game, and end screen.
But if you wanted to use it with your own system or existing project, all you really need is the `lil-dressup.js` file.
